Hello! My name is Antony John. I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for building Autonomous Robotic Systems.
I'm currently interested in learning Computer Vision and Digital Imaging Systems while developing projects that use Machine Learning and Image Recognition in a wide range of applications.
I would love to have a chat with anyone interested in Autonomous Systems, Blockchain, HipHop Music or Cinema.
